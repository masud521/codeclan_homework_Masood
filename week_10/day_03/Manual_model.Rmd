```{r}

library(ggplot2)

```


```{r}

houses <- read_csv("data/kc_house_data.csv")

```

You might like to think about removing some or all of date, id, sqft_living15, sqft_lot15 and zipcode (lat and long provide a better measure of location in any event).



```{r}

# tidy up data. In particular treat condition and grade as factor, as they are
# ordinal categorical
houses_tidy <- houses %>%
  select(-c("id", "date", "sqft_living15", "sqft_lot15", "zipcode")) %>%
  mutate(waterfront = as.logical(waterfront)) %>%
  mutate(renovated = yr_renovated != 0) %>%
  select(-"yr_renovated") %>%
  mutate(condition = as_factor(condition)) %>%
  mutate(grade = as_factor(grade))

glimpse(houses_tidy)

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(infer)

```


```{r}

ames <- read_csv("data/ames.csv")
ames <- clean_names(ames)

glimpse(ames)

```


 Plot a histogram of lot_area. Is the distribution normal?


```{r}
ames %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lot_area)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white", bins = 30)


```


Compute and visualise a bootstrap sampling distribution for the mean(lot_area) of the sold houses.




```{r}

bootstrap_distribution <- ames  %>%
  specify(response = lot_area) %>%
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "mean")

bootstrap_distribution %>%
  visualise(bins = 30)

```


Use your bootstrap distribution to calculate a 95% CI for mean(lot_area), and visualise it on the distribution
```{r}
bootstrap_ci <- bootstrap_distribution %>%
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

bootstrap_ci


```

```{r}

bootstrap_distribution %>%
  visualise(bins = 30)+
  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = bootstrap_ci)
  

```


You would like to know the mean(lot_area) of the sold houses with higher confidence. Calculate the 99% CI for this variable (you can re-use your bootstrap distribution from above). Is it narrower or broader than the 95% CI? Does that make sense?

```{r}
bootstrap_99_ci <- bootstrap_distribution %>%
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.99, type = "percentile")

bootstrap_99_ci


```

```{r}
bootstrap_distribution %>%
  visualise(bins = 30)+
  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = bootstrap_99_ci)

```



Calculate the point estimate of the mean(lot_area)


```{r}
bootstrap_distribution %>%
  summarise(mean(stat))

```

If we take 99% CI visulisation will be broader as confidence level increase so the endpoint.


2 Extension

Calculate a point estimate and 95% CI for the proportion of houses in the data built before 1920. Does the number of reps you use matter? [Investigate reps from 200 up to 50000 memory of your laptop permitting].

Hint - the current implementation of calculate(stat = "prop") in infer is slow! You can get around this by treating the mean in this way: add a new column via mutate(before_1920 = as.numeric(year_built < 1920)) and then calculate(stat = "mean") on this new column]


```{r}

houses_before_1920 <- ames %>%
  mutate(before_1920 = as.numeric(year_built < 1920))




```

```{r}

bootstrap_distribution_1920 <- houses_before_1920  %>%
  specify(response = before_1920) %>%
  generate(reps = 50000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "mean")

```


```{r}
bootstrap_95_ci <- bootstrap_distribution_1920 %>%
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

bootstrap_95_ci

```


 There is only a small difference by changing rep from 200 to 50000

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)

```

Load the data, clean_names() and explore it.

```{r}
mobile_phones <- read_csv("data/20190928-items.csv")

```

```{r}

# clean_names()

mobile_phones <-  clean_names(mobile_phones)

```


```{r}
 
brands <- table(mobile_phones$brand)

brands

```

 from above table we can see Samsung was the highest number of phones in the dataset.
 


Q3
plot the distribution of phone ratings as a probability density, overlaying a fitted normal distribution. Do you think the normal distribution provides a good model of these ratings

```{r}
# mean & sd
samsung_stats <- mobile_phones %>%
  filter(brand == "Samsung") %>%
  summarise(
    num = n(),
    mean(rating),
    sd(rating)
  )

samsung_stats

```


```{r}
# plot the distribution

samsung_ratings <- mobile_phones %>%

  filter(brand == "Samsung") %>%
 ggplot(aes(x = rating)) +
 geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), col = "white", bins = 25)+
  
 stat_function(
   fun = dnorm,
   args = list(
     mean = samsung_stats$`mean(rating)`,
     sd   = samsung_stats$`sd(rating)`
     ),
   col = "red"
 )






```

Explanation:

Our data has been plotted and a normal distribution curve fit. Although it looks a bit skewed, but in reality that value out on the left is probably an outlier rather than a pattern of data demonstrating skew.




Q4

```{r}

mobile_phones %>%
  filter(rating >= samsung_stats$`mean(rating)` - samsung_stats$`sd(rating)`) %>%
  filter(rating <= samsung_stats$`mean(rating)` + samsung_stats$`sd(rating)`) %>%
  summarise(prop_within_1sd = n() / nrow(mobile_phones))


```

#Task 2 - Cake ingredients

# This data set is about the cakes, quantity, measurement and ingredients

# Load data from first csv file

# 1.2 This data is not in tidy form and needs some cleaning before we start analysising.

# 1.3

# Data is in wide format and needs to be long format



# Reshape the data from wide to long format, so that for each code column becomes a row. Name the column code  and values into quantity

# There are so many missing values so we need deciede whether to keep them of drop them


# There are lots of missing values. I would drop the values because otherwise, I will be imputing more missing values than I have.
